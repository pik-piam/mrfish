#' Correct magpie objects
#' @param subtype "Area" data subtype. Areas in square km for each Large Marine Ecosystem obtained from Seaaroundus.org
#' "PrimProdinmgCday" data subtype. Primary Production in mg C day^-1 for each Large Marine Ecosystem obtained from Seaaroundus.org
#' "Degrees" data subtype. relative change to fishery production in degree1p5,degree2p5,degree3p5 scenarios. obtained from Cheung et al 2016
#' @return magpie object of the corrected Cheung et al 2016 data and converted x_PrimProdinmgCday into tCyr^(-1)^km2^(-1)
